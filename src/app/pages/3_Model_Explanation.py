# Introduction
st.markdown("""
### Understanding Our AI Approach

KomuterPulse employs sophisticated deep learning and machine learning techniques to deliver accurate forecasts and 
detect anomalies in transit ridership data. This page provides technical insights into our model architecture, 
training process, and evaluation metrics.

Our solution combines the strengths of multiple AI approaches:
- **LSTM Neural Networks** for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data
- **Isolation Forest** for unsupervised anomaly detection
- **Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful patterns from raw data
- **Ensemble Methods** to combine different modeling approaches for optimal results

# LSTM Architecture Section

st.subheader("LSTM Model Architecture")

st.markdown("""
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are specialized recurrent neural networks capable of learning long-term 
dependencies in sequential data. Our implementation uses a carefully optimized architecture to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

# Visual representation of LSTM architecture
st.markdown("""
```
Input Layer (24 timesteps Ã— 18 features)
    â†“
LSTM Layer (50 units, ReLU activation, return_sequences=False)
    â†“
Dropout Layer (20% dropout rate)
    â†“
Dense Output Layer (1 unit, linear activation)
```

This architecture was selected after extensive experimentation with various configurations:

| Model Type | RMSE | MAE | RÂ² |
|------------|------|-----|-----|
| Basic LSTM | 6.32 | 2.58 | 0.54 |
| Stacked LSTM | 8.30 | 5.44 | 0.20 |
| Bidirectional LSTM | 11.14 | 10.00 | -0.43 |
| Advanced LSTM | 8.66 | 3.68 | 0.13 |

The basic LSTM model demonstrated the best performance across all metrics, particularly in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
and RÂ² (coefficient of determination), indicating superior predictive accuracy.

### Key Feature Descriptions

1. **rolling_max_24h**: Maximum ridership observed in the past 24 hours
2. **ridership_diff_1d**: Change in ridership compared to the same hour one day ago
3. **rolling_mean_6h**: Average ridership over the past 6 hours
4. **ridership_diff_1w**: Change in ridership compared to the same hour one week ago
5. **avg_ridership**: Average historical ridership for this route and hour
6. **ridership_diff_1h**: Change in ridership from the previous hour

These temporal features capture both short-term fluctuations and longer-term patterns in ridership data.

### Anomaly Detection Performance

The hybrid approach outperforms individual methods:

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LSTM Residuals Only | 0.84 | 0.81 | 0.82 |
| Isolation Forest Only | 0.79 | 0.86 | 0.82 |
| **Hybrid Approach** | **0.92** | **0.89** | **0.90** |

By combining both approaches, we reduce false positives while maintaining high sensitivity to different types of anomalies.

# Training and Evaluation
st.markdown("---")
st.subheader("Model Training & Evaluation")

st.markdown("""
### Training Process

The LSTM model was trained using the following approach:

- **Dataset Split**: 80% training, 20% validation 
- **Optimizer**: Adam with initial learning rate of 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 10 epochs monitoring validation loss
- **Learning Rate Reduction**: Factor of 0.2 with patience of 5 epochs
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: Up to 50 with early stopping

### Cross-Validation Results

The model was evaluated using time-series cross-validation to ensure robust performance across different time periods.
Average metrics across folds:

- **RMSE**: 6.32 Â± 0.41
- **MAE**: 2.58 Â± 0.23
- **RÂ²**: 0.54 Â± 0.06

### Multi-Step Forecasting Performance

The model can generate forecasts up to 24 hours into the future with degrading performance:

| Forecast Horizon | RMSE | MAE | RÂ² |
|------------------|------|-----|-----|
| 1 hour ahead | 6.32 | 2.58 | 0.54 |
| 6 hours ahead | 8.75 | 3.91 | 0.41 |
| 12 hours ahead | 11.23 | 5.46 | 0.30 |
| 24 hours ahead | 14.87 | 7.62 | 0.19 |

For longer horizons, we implement a rolling forecast approach where predictions are iteratively used as inputs for
subsequent predictions, with additional techniques to mitigate error accumulation.
