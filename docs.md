# KomuterPulse Streamlit Platform Documentation

## Platform Choice

We recommend using **Streamlit** for the KomuterPulse platform because:
- It is ideal for data science applications and ML model deployment
- Provides interactive visualizations out of the box
- Enables easy creation of real-time dashboards
- Seamlessly supports both Python and ML model integration
- Offers built-in components for time series visualization

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the basic Streamlit environment:**
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly altair tensorflow scikit-learn
     ```
2. **Create a basic `main.py` to start:**
   - Set up the dashboard layout, sidebar, and placeholders for key metrics and visualizations.
3. **Create the model loading utility:**
   - Implement a utility to load trained models and preprocessing information for inference.
4. **Start by implementing the basic dashboard structure:**
   - Add navigation, key metrics, and placeholders for visualizations.
5. **Integrate your existing LSTM model for predictions:**
   - Use the model loading utility to make predictions and display results.
6. **Add real-time data processing capabilities:**
   - Process and visualize incoming data in real time.
7. **Implement the visualization components:**
   - Use Streamlit and Plotly for interactive charts and heatmaps.
8. **Add interactive features and user controls:**
   - Filters, selectors, and user-driven analysis tools.
9. **Implement the alert system:**
   - Real-time notifications and anomaly alerts.
10. **Add authentication if needed:**
    - Secure the platform for authorized users.
11. **Deploy the application:**
    - Host the Streamlit app for access by stakeholders.

## Next Steps
- Begin with the basic dashboard structure in `main.py`
- Gradually implement each feature and page as outlined above
- Integrate models and data as you progress
